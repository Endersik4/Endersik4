- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam. 19 years old with a dream to work on best RPG games with best story that milions of players love.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in games with the best storyline, 3D object modeling and most of all game development. <br/>I devote almost all my free time to it because of the passion I have for it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 C++ by making <a href="https://endersik4.github.io/gry_ue4.html?"> games</a> and <a href="https://endersik4.github.io/grafika.html"> mistakes </a>
